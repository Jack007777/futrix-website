      <h1>About Futrix</h1>
      <p>
        Futrix develops commercial service robots for practical, high-traffic environments in Europe.
        We focus on reliability, clear system integration, and measurable outcomes for professional operators.
        Our teams work with industrial clients, system integrators, and public facilities that need robots to
        perform safely and consistently every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        We build for real deployment conditions: mixed pedestrian flow, changing layouts, and long operating hours.
        Our work starts with the engineering fundamentals and continues through commissioning, integration, and
        ongoing support. The result is a robot system that can be deployed, monitored, and improved without
        interrupting operations.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to make robotic automation dependable and practical for commercial use. We design systems
        that support daily workflows instead of adding complexity. Our vision is a European market where service
        robots are adopted because they are reliable, compliant, and easy to integrate into existing processes.
      </p>

      <h2>Engineering &amp; Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Futrix is engineering-driven. We prioritize navigation stability, obstacle awareness, and predictable
        behavior in dynamic spaces. Our robots are designed for indoor operations and can be connected to
        dispatching or facility systems to support scheduling, reporting, and maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value practical performance over marketing claims. That means clear specifications, verified operating
        ranges, and straightforward serviceability. We also emphasize data security and European compliance
        requirements when integrating systems in public and regulated environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Markets &amp; Applications</h2>
      <p>
        Futrix systems are used where reliability and safety are critical. Typical application areas include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Airports with complex passenger flows and large operational zones</li>
        <li>Hospitals that require quiet, consistent service support</li>
        <li>Schools and campuses with daily, repeatable transport or cleaning needs</li>
        <li>Commercial and industrial facilities that value efficiency and traceability</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We work closely with operators to understand routes, constraints, and integration points. Projects usually
        include on-site assessment, deployment planning, integration with existing systems, and user training.
        We provide documentation, remote support, and long-term maintenance options to keep systems running.
      </p>
      <p>
        Futrix delivers engineering you can rely on: transparent specifications, predictable deployment, and
        support aligned with European compliance expectations.
